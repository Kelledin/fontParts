# FontParts

An API for interacting with the parts of fonts during the font development process. FontParts is a candidate to replace the [RoboFab library](http://robofab.com). [The documentation is at fontparts.readthedocs.io.](http://fontparts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

*This is a work in progress. We are still working out the API, abstract implementation, example implementation, test suite and documentation.* Want to contribute? Great! Get in touch!
